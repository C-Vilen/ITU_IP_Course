# Drinking Song Generator

## Exercise

Your Christmas parties are not going as well as you had hoped. You therefore decide to generate some merry drinking songs. All you have to come up with are the titles, and everything else follows. For instance, the song "99 bottles of beer" goes like:

```sh
99 bottles of beer on the wall
99 bottles of beer
Take one down, pass it around
98 bottles of beer on the wall

98 bottles of beer on the wall
98 bottles of beer
Take one down, pass it around
97 bottles of beer on the wall

...

2 bottles of beer on the wall
2 bottles of beer
Take one down, pass it around
One bottle of beer on the wall

One bottle of beer on the wall
One bottle of beer
Take one down, pass it around
No more bottles of beer on the wall
```

where the "..." should be replaced by all the verses in between. The lesser known "14 kegs of mead" goes like:

```sh
14 kegs of mead on the wall
14 kegs of mead
Take one down, pass it around
13 kegs of mead on the wall

13 kegs of mead on the wall
13 kegs of mead
Take one down, pass it around
12 kegs of mead on the wall

...

2 kegs of mead on the wall
2 kegs of mead
Take one down, pass it around
One keg of mead on the wall

One keg of mead on the wall
One keg of mead
Take one down, pass it around
No more kegs of mead on the wall
```

You must be able to print the lyrics to any song with a title of the form "`<N> <container>`s of `<drink>`".
